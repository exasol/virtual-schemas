# Virtual Schemas 6.0.3, released 2025-03-06

Code name: Developer FAQ

## Summary

This release adds a developer FAQ to the root project of all virtual schemas that covers *language-independent* developer questions.

We also removed language-specific content from this repository, since it is the portal to virtual schemas of all languages except links to other documents.

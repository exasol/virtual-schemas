# Supported Dialects

The purpose of this page is to provide detailed instructions for each of the supported dialects on how to get started. Typical questions are
* Which **JDBC driver** is used, which files have to be uploaded and included when creating the adapter script.
* How does the **CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA** statement look like, i.e. which properties are required.
* **Data source specific notes**, like authentication with Kerberos, supported capabilities or things to consider regarding the data type mapping.

As an entry point we recommend you follow the [step-by-step deployment guide](deploying_the_virtual_schema_adapter.md) which will link to this page whenever needed.

## Before you Start

Please note that the syntax for creating adapter scripts is not recognized by all SQL clients. 
[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) for example. If you encounter such a problem, try a different client.

# JDBC Adapter for Virtual Schemas

## Overview

The JDBC adapter for virtual schemas allows you to connect to JDBC data sources like Hive, Oracle, Teradata, Exasol or any other data source supporting JDBC.
It uses the well proven ```IMPORT FROM JDBC``` Exasol statement behind the scenes to obtain the requested data, when running a query on a virtual table. 
The JDBC adapter also serves as the reference adapter for the Exasol virtual schema framework.

You can find the list of supported dialects in [the list of supported dilects](#list-of-supported-dialects).

The so called `GENERIC` dialect is designed to work with any JDBC driver. It derives the SQL dialect from the JDBC driver metadata. 
However, it does not support any capabilities and might fail if the data source has special syntax or data types, so it should only be used for evaluation purposes.

If you are interested in a introduction to virtual schemas please refer to the Exasol user manual. 
You can find it in the [download area of the Exasol user portal](https://www.exasol.com/portal/display/DOC/Database+User+Manual).

## Before you Start

Please note that the syntax for creating adapter scripts is not recognized by all SQL clients. 
[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) for example. If you encounter such a problem, try a different client.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the JDBC adapter for virtual schemas you have to deploy the adapter and the JDBC driver of your data source in your Exasol database.
Please follow the [step-by-step deployment guide](deploying_the_virtual_schema_adapter.md).

## Using the Adapter
The following statements demonstrate how you can use virtual schemas with the JDBC adapter to connect to a Hive system. 
Please scroll down to see a list of all properties supported by the JDBC adapter.

First we create a virtual schema using the JDBC adapter. The adapter will retrieve the metadata via JDBC and map them to virtual tables. 
The metadata (virtual tables, columns and data types) are then cached in Exasol.

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION hive_conn TO 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default' USER 'hive-usr' IDENTIFIED BY 'hive-pwd';

CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive USING adapter.jdbc_adapter WITH
  SQL_DIALECT     = 'HIVE'
  CONNECTION_NAME = 'HIVE_CONN'
  SCHEMA_NAME     = 'default';
```

We can now explore the tables in the virtual schema, just like for a regular schema:

```sql
OPEN SCHEMA hive;
SELECT * FROM cat;
DESCRIBE clicks;
```

And we can run arbitrary queries on the virtual tables:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM clicks;
SELECT DISTINCT USER_ID FROM clicks;
```

Behind the scenes the Exasol command `IMPORT FROM JDBC` will be executed to obtain the data needed from the data source to fulfil the query. 
The Exasol database interacts with the adapter to pushdown as much as possible to the data source (e.g. filters, aggregations or `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT`), 
while considering the capabilities of the data source.

Let's combine a virtual and a native tables in a query:

```sql
SELECT * from clicks JOIN native_schema.users on clicks.userid = users.id;
```

You can refresh the schemas metadata, e.g. if tables were added in the remote system:

```sql
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive REFRESH;
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive REFRESH TABLES t1 t2; -- refresh only these tables
```

Or set properties. Depending on the adapter and the property you set this might update the metadata or not. 
In our example the metadata are affected, because afterwards the virtual schema will only expose two virtual tables.

```sql
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive SET TABLE_FILTER='CUSTOMERS, CLICKS';
```

Finally you can unset properties:

```sql
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive SET TABLE_FILTER=null;
```

Or drop the virtual schema:

```sql
DROP VIRTUAL SCHEMA hive CASCADE;
```

### Adapter Properties
The following properties can be used to control the behavior of the JDBC adapter. 
As you see above, these properties can be defined in `CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA` or changed afterwards via `ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA SET`. 
Note that properties are always strings, like `TABLE_FILTER='T1,T2'`.

#### Mandatory Properties

Property                    | Value
--------------------------- | -----------
**SQL_DIALECT**             | Name of the SQL dialect: EXASOL, HIVE, IMPALA, ORACLE, TERADATA, REDSHIFT or GENERIC (case insensitive). If you try generating a virtual schema without specifying this property you will see all available dialects in the error message.

**Mandatory Connection Specification:**

Either specify `CONNECTION_NAME` OR provide `CONNECTION_STRING`, `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.

Property                    | Value
--------------------------- | -----------
**CONNECTION_NAME**         | Name of the connection created with `CREATE CONNECTION` which contains the JDBC connection string, the username and password. If you defined this property then it is not allowed to set `CONNECTION_STRING`, `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. We recommend using this property to ensure that the password will not be shown in the logfiles.
**CONNECTION_STRING**       | The JDBC connection string. Only required if `CONNECTION_NAME` is not set.
**USERNAME**                | Username for authentication. Only required if `CONNECTION_NAME` is not set.
**PASSWORD**                | Password for authentication. Only required if `CONNECTION_NAME` is not set.


#### Common Optional Properties

Property                    | Value
--------------------------- | -----------
**CATALOG_NAME**            | The name of the remote JDBC catalog. This is usually case-sensitive, depending on the dialect. It depends on the dialect whether you have to specify this or not. Usually you have to specify it if the data source JDBC driver supports the concepts of catalogs.
**SCHEMA_NAME**             | The name of the remote JDBC schema. This is usually case-sensitive, depending on the dialect. It depends on the dialect whether you have to specify this or not. Usually you have to specify it if the data source JDBC driver supports the concepts of schemas.
**TABLE_FILTER**            | A comma-separated list of table names (case sensitive). Only these tables will be available as virtual tables, other tables are ignored. Use this if you don't want to have all remote tables in your virtual schema.

#### Advanced Optional Properties

Property                    | Value
--------------------------- | -----------
**IMPORT_FROM_EXA**         | Only relevant if your data source is EXASOL. Either `TRUE` or `FALSE` (default). If true, `IMPORT FROM EXA` will be used for the pushdown instead of `IMPORT FROM JDBC`. You have to define `EXA_CONNECTION_STRING` if this property is true.
**EXA_CONNECTION_STRING**   | The connection string used for `IMPORT FROM EXA` in the format 'hostname:port'.
**IMPORT_FROM_ORA**         | Similar to `IMPORT_FROM_EXA` but for an Oracle data source. If enabled, the more performant `IMPORT FROM ORA` operation will be used in place of `IMPORT FROM JDBC`. You also need to define `ORA_CONNECTION_NAME` if this property is set to `TRUE`.
**ORA_CONNECTION_NAME**     | Name of the connection to an Oracle database created with `CREATE CONNECTION`. Used by `IMPORT FROM ORA`.
**IS_LOCAL**                | Only relevant if your data source is the same Exasol database where you create the virtual schema. Either `TRUE` or `FALSE` (default). If true, you are connecting to the local Exasol database (e.g. for testing purposes). In this case, the adapter can avoid the `IMPORT FROM JDBC` overhead.
**EXCEPTION_HANDLING**      | Activates or deactivates different exception handling modes. Supported values: `IGNORE_INVALID_VIEWS` and `NONE` (default). Currently this property only affects the Teradata dialect.
**EXCLUDED_CAPABILITIES**   | A comma-separated list of capabilities that you want to deactivate (although the adapter might support them).
**IGNORE_ERRORS**           | Is used to ignore errors thrown by the adapter. Supported values: 'POSTGRESQL_UPPERCASE_TABLES' (see PostgreSQL dialect documentation).

## Limitations

## Unrecognized and Unsupported Data Types

Not all data types present in a source database have a matching equivalent in Exasol. Also software updates on the source database can introduce new data type that the Virtual schema does not recognize.

There are a few important things you need to know about those data types.

1. Columns of an unrecognized / unsupported data type are not mapped in a Virtual Schema. From Exasol's perspective those columns do not exist on a table. This is done so that tables containing those columns can still be mapped and do not have to be rejected as a whole.
2. You can't query columns of an unrecognized / unsupported data type. If the source table contains them, you have to *explicitly* exclude them from the query. You can for example not use the asterisk (`*`) on a table that contains one ore more of those columns. This will result in an error issued by the Virtual schema.
3. If you want to query all columns except unsupported, add `1` to the columns list. Otherwise you will see the same error as if you query with the asterisk (`*`).
    For example, a table contains 3 columns: `bool_column` BOOLEAN, `timestamp_column` TIMESTAMP, `blob_column` BLOB. The column BLOB is not supported. If you want to query two other columns, use: `SELECT "bool_column", "timestamp_column", 1 FROM table_name;` .
4. You can't use functions that result in an unsupported / unknown data type.

# PostgreSQL SQL Dialect

## JDBC Driver

The PostgreSQL dialect was tested with JDBC driver version 42.0.0 and PostgreSQL 9.6.2 .

## Adapter Script

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE JAVA ADAPTER SCRIPT adapter.jdbc_adapter 
  AS
  
  // This is the class implementing the callback method of the adapter script
  %scriptclass com.exasol.adapter.jdbc.JdbcAdapter;

  // This will add the adapter jar to the classpath so that it can be used inside the adapter script
  // Replace the names of the bucketfs and the bucket with the ones you used.
  %jar /buckets/bucketfs1/bucket1/virtualschema-jdbc-adapter-dist-1.13.0.jar;
									 
  // You have to add all files of the data source jdbc driver here (e.g. MySQL or Hive)
  %jar /buckets/bucketfs1/bucket1/postgresql-42.0.0.jar;

/
```

## Creating a Virtual Schema

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA postgres
	USING adapter.jdbc_adapter 
	WITH
	SQL_DIALECT = 'POSTGRESQL'
	CATALOG_NAME = 'postgres'
	SCHEMA_NAME = 'public'
	CONNECTION_NAME = 'POSTGRES_DOCKER'
	;
```

## Postgres identifiers

In contrast to EXASOL, PostgreSQL does not treat identifiers as specified in the SQL standard. PostgreSQL folds unquoted identifiers to lower case instead of upper case. The adapter has two modes for handling this:

### Automatic Identifier conversion

This is the default mode for handling identifiers, but can also be set explicitly by the following property:
```sql
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA postgres SET POSTGRESQL_IDENTIFIER_MAPPING = 'CONVERT_TO_UPPER';
```

In this mode you don't have to care about identifier handling. Everything will work out of the box as long as you **don't use quoted identifiers** (in the PostgreSQL Schema as well as in the EXASOL Virtual Schema). More specifically everything will work as long as there are no identifiers in the PostgreSQL database that contain upper case characters. If that is the case an error will be thrown when creating or refreshing the virtual schema.
In order to create or refresh the virtual schema regrardlessly, you can specifiy that the adapter should ignore this specific error:
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA postgres
	USING adapter.jdbc_adapter 
	WITH
	SQL_DIALECT = 'POSTGRESQL'
	CATALOG_NAME = 'postgres'
	SCHEMA_NAME = 'public'
	CONNECTION_NAME = 'POSTGRES_DOCKER'
	IGNORE_ERRORS = 'POSTGRESQL_UPPERCASE_TABLES'
;
```
You can also set this property for an exitsing virtual schema:
```sql
ALTER VIRTUAL SCHEMA postgres SET IGNORE_ERRORS = 'POSTGRESQL_UPPERCASE_TABLES';
```
However you **won't be able to query the identifier containing the upper case character**, you will get an error when querying the virtual table.

A best practice for this mode is: **never quote identifiers** (in the PostgreSQL Schema as well as in the EXASOL Virtual Schema). This way everything works without having to change your queries.
An alternative is to use the second mode for identifier handling (see below).

### PostgreSQL like identifier handling

If you use quoting on the PostgreSQL side and have identifiers with uppercase characters, this mode is recommended. The PostgreSQL like identifier handling does no case conversions, but mirrors the PostgreSQL metadata as is. A small example to make this clear:
```sql
--Postgres Schema
CREATE TABLE "MyTable"("Col1" VARCHAR(100));
CREATE TABLE MySecondTable(Col1 VARCHAR(100));
--Postgres Queries
SELECT "Col1" FROM "MyTable";
SELECT Col1 FROM MySecondTable;
```
```sql
--Create Virtual Schema on EXASOL side
CREATE VIRTUAL SCHEMA postgres
	USING adapter.jdbc_adapter 
	WITH
	SQL_DIALECT = 'POSTGRESQL'
	CATALOG_NAME = 'postgres'
	SCHEMA_NAME = 'public'
	CONNECTION_NAME = 'POSTGRES_DOCKER'
	POSTGRESQL_IDENTIFIER_MAPPING = 'PRESERVE_ORIGINAL_CASE'
;
-- Open Schema and see what tables are there
open schema postgres;
select * from cat;
-- result -->
-- TABLE_NAME	TABLE_TYPE
-- ----------------------
-- MyTable       | TABLE
-- mysecondtable | TABLE
```
As you see `MySecondTable` is displayed in lower case in the virtual schema catalog. This is exactly like it is on the PostgreSQL side, but since unquoted identifiers are folded differently in PostgreSQL you cannot query the table like you did in PostgreSQL:
```sql
--Querying the virtual schema
--> this works
SELECT "Col1" FROM postgres."MyTable";

--> this does not work
SELECT Col1 FROM postgres.MySecondTable;
--> Error:
--  [Code: 0, SQL State: 42000]  object "POSTGRES"."MYSECONDTABLE" not found [line 1, column 18]

--> this works
SELECT "col1" FROM postgres."mysecondtable";
```
Unquoted identifiers are converted to lowercase on the PostgreSQL side, and since there is no catalog conversion these identifiers are also lowercase on the EXASOL side. To query a lowercase identifier you have to use quotes in EXASOL, because everything that is unquoted gets folded to uppercase. 

A best practice for this mode is: **always quote identifiers** (in the PostgreSQL Schema as well as in the EXASOL Virtual Schema). This way everything works without having to change you queries.

# How to develop and test a dialect
This page describes how you can develop and semi-automatically test an dialect for the JDBC adapter. The integration tests are work in progress.

## How to develop a dialect
We recommend the following steps for the development of a dialect.
Please look up in the sourcecode of the ```com.exasol.adapter.dialects.SqlDialect``` for the methods you can override.
You can also have a look at the implementation of an existing dialect for inspiration.

### Setup data source
* Setup and start the database
* Testdata: Create a test schema with a simple table (simple data types)

### Setup EXASOL
* Setup and start an EXASOL database with virtual schemas feature
* Upload the JDBC drivers of the data source via EXAOperation
* Manual test: query data from the data source via IMPORT FROM JDBC

### Catalog, Schema & Table Mapping
* Override the SqlDialect methods for catalog, schema and table mapping
* Manual test: create a virtual schema by specifying the catalog and/or schema.

### Data Type Mapping
* Testdata: Create a table with all data types and at least one row of data
* Override the SqlDialect method for data type mapping
* Automatic test: sys tables show virtual table and columns with correctly mapped type
* Automatic test: running SELECT on the virtual table returns the expected result

### Identifier Case Handling & Quoting
* Testdata: Create a schema/table/column with mixed case (if supported)
* Automatic test: sys tables correct
* Automatic test: SELECT works as expected

### Projection Capability
* Add capability
* Automatic test: pushed down & correct result (incl. EXPLAIN VIRTUAL). Also test with mixed case columns.

### Predicates and Literal Capabilities
* Add capabilities for supported literals and predicates (e.g. c1='foo')
* Automatic test: pushed down & correct result (incl. EXPLAIN VIRTUAL) for all predicates & literals

### Aggregation & Set Function Capabilities
* Add capabilities for aggregations and aggregation functions
* Automatic test: pushed down & correct result (incl. EXPLAIN VIRTUAL) for all set functions

### Order By / Limit Capabilities
* Testdata: Create a table with null values and non-null values, to check null collation.
* Add capabilities for order by and/or limit
* Automatic test: pushed down & correct result (incl. EXPLAIN VIRTUAL)
* Automatic test: default null collation, explicit NULLS FIRST/LAST

### Scalar Function Capabilities
* Add capabilities for scalar functions
* Automatic test: pushed down & correct result (incl. EXPLAIN VIRTUAL)

### Views
* Testdata: Create a simple view, e.g. joining two existing tables
* Automatic test: Query the view, optionally e.g. with a filter.

## How to start integration tests
We assume that you have a running EXASOL and data source database with all required test tables.

We use following Maven phases for our integration tests:
* pre-integration-test phase is used to automatically deploy the latest jdbc adapter jar (based on your latest code modifications)
* integration-test phase is used to execute the actual integration tests

Note that to check whether the integration-tests were successful, you have to run the verify Maven phase.

You can start the integration tests as follows:
```
mvn clean package && mvn verify -Pit -Dintegrationtest.configfile=/path/to/your/integration-test-config.yaml
```

This will run all integration tests, i.e. all junit tests with the suffix "IT" in the filename. The yaml configuration file stores the information for your test environment like jdbc connection strings, paths and credentials.
